## 🔍 **Project Overview**
**🚀 An AI-powered system** designed to assess mango quality based on **🟢 Texture**, **🍅 Health**, and **🥭 Ripeness**.  
This project leverages **📸 Image Processing** and **🤖 Deep Learning Techniques** to automate the classification of mangoes for better quality control.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset used in this project consists of **mango images** collected from publicly available sources. Each mango sample is assessed based on three key parameters: **Texture, Healthiness, and Maturity**, using a **Likert scale (1 to 5)**.

## 📊 Data Labeling and Annotation  
Each mango image in the dataset is labeled based on the following assessment criteria:  

### **1️⃣ Texture Assessment**  
The texture of a mango plays a crucial role in determining its quality. This assessment evaluates the **surface characteristics** such as smoothness, roughness, and firmness. A well-textured mango is often associated with better freshness and ripeness.  

📌 **Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
✅ **1 – Very Smooth:** The surface is completely even and free of rough patches.  
✅ **2 – Smooth:** Minimal irregularities with a mostly even texture.  
✅ **3 – Moderately Smooth:** Some rough patches but still mostly uniform.  
✅ **4 – Slightly Rough:** Noticeable bumps or roughness affecting the surface quality.  
✅ **5 – Very Rough:** Highly uneven texture with significant irregularities.

### **2️⃣ Healthiness Assessment**  
This parameter measures the **overall health condition** of the mango, detecting signs of diseases, blemishes, or decay. A healthier mango is more suitable for consumption and storage.  

📌 **Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
✅ **1 – Very Healthy:** Completely fresh, no visible blemishes or spots.  
✅ **2 – Healthy:** Minor imperfections but no significant quality issues.  
✅ **3 – Moderately Healthy:** Some visible defects but still edible.  
✅ **4 – Slightly Unhealthy:** Noticeable damage, minor signs of spoilage.  
✅ **5 – Very Unhealthy:** Severe decay, bruises, or signs of disease.

### **3️⃣ Maturity Assessment**  
Maturity assessment helps determine whether the mango is at its optimal ripeness for consumption or storage.  

📌 **Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
✅ **1 – Overripe:** The mango is past its prime, very soft, and may show signs of fermentation.  
✅ **2 – Ripe:** Perfectly mature, soft but firm, ready for consumption.  
✅ **3 – Partially Ripe:** Some areas are ripe while others are still firm.  
✅ **4 – Early Ripe:** More firm than soft, slightly underripe but maturing.  
✅ **5 – Unripe:** Hard, green, and not yet suitable for consumption.
