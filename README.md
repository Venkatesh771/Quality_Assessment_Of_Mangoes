## 🔍 **Project Overview**
**🚀 An AI-powered system** designed to assess mango quality based on **🟢 Texture**, **🍅 Health**, and **🥭 Ripeness**.  
This project leverages **📸 Image Processing** and **🤖 Deep Learning Techniques** to automate the classification of mangoes for better quality control.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset used in this project consists of **mango images** collected from publicly available sources. Each mango sample is assessed based on three key parameters: **Texture, Healthiness, and Maturity**, using a **Likert scale (1 to 5)**.

## 📊 Data Labeling and Annotation  
Each mango image in the dataset is labeled based on the following assessment criteria:  

### **1️⃣ Texture Assessment**  
Evaluates the **surface quality** of the mango image considering smoothness, roughness, and firmness.  

**Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
- **1** = Very Smooth  
- **2** = Smooth  
- **3** = Moderately Smooth  
- **4** = Slightly Rough  
- **5** = Very Rough  

---

### **2️⃣ Healthiness Assessment**  
Determines the **overall health condition** of the mango, identifying any visible defects or diseases.  

**Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
- **1** = Very Healthy  
- **2** = Healthy  
- **3** = Moderately Healthy  
- **4** = Slightly Unhealthy  
- **5** = Very Unhealthy  

---

### **3️⃣ Maturity Assessment**  
Measures the **ripeness** of the mango based on its appearance.  

**Likert Scale (1 to 5):**  
- **1** = Overripe  
- **2** = Ripe  
- **3** = Partially Ripe  
- **4** = Early Ripe  
- **5** = Unripe
